# TDT4240 introduction exercise
Run the project by opening it in Android studio.
The game/exercises is presented in landscape and tested with a Nexus 5X running Android 9.0 (Pie) virtual device.
The first screen presented to the user is the menu screen, where you can choose which task to run.
Every task has a back button (upper left corner) making it possible to go back to the menu.
## Task 1 - Sprites
Basic helicopter moving around on the screen by it self. When hitting the screen edge the helicopter will change direction.
## Task 2 - Input and text
Same helicopter as in task 1, but here it is possible to move the helicopter by using the arrow keys or on-screen controls.
The position of the helicopter can also be viewed in the upper left corner, next to the back button.
## Task 3 - Animation, timing, and collison detection
This task includes the same helicopter as task 1, but with animation and multiple sprites. 
If the different helicopters collide they will bounce off each other. Like in task 1 the helicopters cannot leave the screen.
## Task 4 - Pong
This is a completely different task where the classic pong game is implemented as a 2-player version.
One of the players uses the up and down arrow keys while the other uses the mouse. First player to 21 points wins the game!
